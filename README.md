# Space rework

Project to overhaul the `spacecodeur` course platform. The redesign of the project is an opportunity to explore cool technologies; TypeScript/React for the frontend and Rust (Axum) for the backend, all wrapped in a very young framework called `tuono`.

A CI/CD pipeline is set up via Jenkins, and the application is hosted through cloud providers (AWS, ...).
